# preconditioning the smith network with 2.5 / 1.25 / 10.0 yields an UNCLEAN network, that is nevertheless convertible
# to a consistent mesh (visually obvious by viewing the network amv file in am_morphview). the -force-meshing switch is
# used to overwrite the restriction of meshing only cell networks that are confirmed as clean by geometric analysis.
# this example uses the max-chordal-depth partitioning strategy and non-default number 16 of angular segments for canal
# surface meshing.
